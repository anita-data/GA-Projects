We have a custom labelling environment built on our Map Browser product that allows our labelling team to annotate 2D, 3D and source imagery. We use algorithms in the loop to enhance the human labelling of millions of images, and automatically produce training data sets for ML that continually grow and improve in quality. We also facilitate the creation of new labelling projects, as we seek to build a richer machine learning derived picture of our physical world.,At Nearmap, every opinion matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact.
